Helly's theorem on intersecting convex sets gave birth to a very fruitful area of discrete geometry called Geometric Transversal Theory. This area has rich interactions with computational geometry, topology and combinatorics. Although the progress throughout the years has been substantial, there are still many interesting and deep open questions to solve.

This mini-course is a research-oriented introduction to the topic. It is based on the diagram at http://www.nekomath.com/gtt. We will overview some interrelated theorems and give a sketch of their proofs. A wide variety of open problems will be presented.
